# LANGUAGE-LEARNER-ASSISTANT
Language Learning Partner is a chat-based AI agent designed to help users practice and improve foreign language skills through natural conversation. The system simulates a friendly language partner that not only chats with the user but also corrects grammar, explains mistakes, introduces new vocabulary, and provides pronunciation tips.

The agent adapts to the user’s performance, adjusting difficulty levels based on progress and keeping track of challenging words or concepts. Its memory allows it to recall past interactions, highlight repeated errors, and provide personalized feedback, making language learning interactive and tailored.

The system is built with multiple specialized agents:

Conversation Agent – Manages dialogue flow and engages users naturally.

Grammar Correction Agent – Detects mistakes and offers polite corrections or hints.

Vocabulary Agent – Introduces new words, provides definitions, example sentences, and phonetics.

Progress/Difficulty Agent – Monitors user performance and adapts challenge levels.

Memory Agent – Tracks past interactions, mistakes, and vocabulary for review.

The project is implemented using Langflow and LLMs, providing a flexible, modular structure that can be extended with translation APIs, flashcard generation, or audio pronunciation support. It is ideal for learners who want a conversational and adaptive learning experience rather than traditional static lessons.

Overall, the Language Learning Partner serves as an intelligent, interactive companion that makes practicing a foreign language engaging, personalized, and effective.
