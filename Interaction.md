Language Learning Partner
Introduction

The Language Learning Partner is a chat-based AI designed to help users practice foreign languages through natural conversation. Unlike traditional learning apps, it provides real-time grammar correction, vocabulary guidance, pronunciation tips, and personalized progress tracking. By simulating an intelligent conversational partner, it adapts to the user‚Äôs skill level, highlights weaknesses, and encourages effective language practice.

This document demonstrates how users interact with the system, showing sample dialogues, handling of mistakes, vocabulary queries, pronunciation guidance, difficulty adjustments, and review of weak words.

Happy Path: Basic Practice

User: "I want to practice German today."
AI: "Hallo! Wunderbar, lass uns anfangen. How do you say 'Good morning' in German?"
User: "Guten Morgen"
AI: "Perfect! That was correct. üòä Want to try a longer sentence?"

Grammar Mistake Example

User: "i going to school everyday"
AI: "‚úçÔ∏è Correction: 'I go to school every day.' Remember: 'I' should always be uppercase; 'every day' is two words."

Vocabulary Request

User: "What does 'Schmetterling' mean?"
AI: "'Schmetterling' means butterfly in German. Example: 'Der Schmetterling fliegt im Garten.' Can you try using it in a sentence?"

Pronunciation / Accent Feedback

User: "How do I pronounce 'r' in French?"
AI: "The French 'r' is guttural. Try making a sound at the back of your throat. Repeat: 'rue, rouge, rire' slowly and listen to native speakers."

Difficulty Adjustment

The agent simplifies prompts if the user struggles repeatedly.

The agent increases complexity when the user demonstrates proficiency.

Example output: "Great job! Let's try a longer sentence with past tense now."

Review Weak Words

User: "I want to review the words I got wrong last time."
AI: "Sure! You often struggle with 'verschieden', '√ºber', 'wegen'. Let's make 3 example sentences using them now."
